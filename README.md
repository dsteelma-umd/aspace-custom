# aspace-custom

UMD customizations to the stock ArchvesSpace
([https://archivesspace.org/](https://archivesspace.org/))
application.

Also includes Dockerfiles for creating the Docker images used by Kubernetes.

## Directories

### docker_config/archivesspace/

Files/directories used to configure the ArchivesSpace Docker image.

#### docker_config/archivesspace/archivesspace

The files in this directory are directly copied (overlaid) on top of a
stock ArchivesSpace distribution.

#### docker_config/archivesspace/files/

The files in this directory are plugin-related files that are copied in to an
ArchivesSpace distribution by the "scripts/plugins.sh" script.

The files cannot be placed in the "archivesspace" directory, because the
required plugin directories don't exist until the "plugins.sh" script creates
them,

#### docker_config/archivesspace/config/

Holds the "plugins" files specifying the ArchivesSpace plugins used by the
UMD version of ArchivesSpace.

#### docker_config/archivesspace/scripts/

Holds the "plugins.sh" script for downloading and installing the ArchivesSpace
plugins specified in the "archivesspace/config/config.rb" file.

### docker_config/solr/

Files/directories used to configure the ArchivesSpace Solr Docker image.
